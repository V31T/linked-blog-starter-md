Following FlowAI turbo README.md
- had to install rust, and setuptools
	- rust & cargo error thrown
		- forgot to get pic
	- apparently setuptools are not preinstalled into venv environments anymore so must preinstall it in every venv environment

FLOW TURBO TECH DEMO
- super app that has ai and deep learning models integrated
	- working to eliminate the entire 85% of the day for sales rep
	- eliminating 6 hours of manual work
- 1 unified account that works for all Flow products
	- 3 seperate repos and 3 seperate backend networks
		- do not comingle the code
- trying to consolidate sales tools into Flow Turbo, as the world's fastest UI/UX design (negating screen switching that sale reps do)
- WE R NOT A CRM, salesforce can be exported as csv's
	- csv's are analyzed by the ai model to give a representation of who is most likely to pickup the phone and even make a sale
	- unified access integrations
		-  integrated with google gmail and calendar and zoom
- WE ARE TRYING TO GET RID OF BROWSERS EXTENSIONS AND OTHERS
- CRM activity logging
	- this is how sale reps get credit for making sales
- biggest struggle for deveopment was getting data
	- FLOW nebula is the data fetching application

Random meeting
- first priority 
	- dev branch code has not been pushed dev
	- codebase is consistent with dev branch
		- dev branch is updated
	- we shouldnt have a lot of trouble to make it work
		- time to start integrating features that are being developed on separate branches
- TASK
	- AI flat files feature
		- branch data will be shared with us later
		- info about the feature/dataflow:
				- Flow Turbo being used by sales rep
				- they have csv with prospects
					- can make api calls to get other data from other crms
				- when sales rep uploads the CSV file, our content must make call to savecontent API
					- problem: csv can come from many different sources (hubspot crm, zalesforce crm, zoominfo or other lead source databases)
						- customer may not be comfortable with us handling their api integrations
					- we want them to be able to make their own call to their own API
					- problem: when uploading csv files from different resources, the format is different 
					- pipeline
						- csv upload
						- goes to backend
						- columns are extracted
						- columns are mapped to our database columns
							- this means we must normalize column name
								- being mapped to a standard column name 
						- columns are saved to the database
					- integrated by another developer who left @Arnav Raviraj talk to him for any questions about the code
				- initially the main branch was fully functional, but some changes to the database messed up the entire main branch
				- so dev branch is completely broken, BUT individual features work
					- ind features = API
		- focus on familiarizing with the database
		- UP TO US TO DECIDE THE ORDER OF APPROACHING THE PROBLEM
			- WE WILL MEET EVERYDAY take your time, go through the architecture diagram
	- first thing the broke was the lift of contact, because the API broke and the frontend was not able to retrieve the contact because the primary key changed
- familiarize with product features and dataflow
