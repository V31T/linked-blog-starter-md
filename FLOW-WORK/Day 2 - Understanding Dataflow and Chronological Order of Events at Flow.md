Scrum Meeting:
- figuring out if all of these branches even work anymore

meting with rishabh
- it works but not implemented correctly
- the deep learning model that is being used for the selection of the account

This team is for code revaluation
- many people have left, wants us to check all the branches that are not in the main and check with the Order of Events at Flow
- Starting at the AI flat files feature
	- need to go through the entire code (chronological order of events at flow)
		- check which ones arent in main yet (in their own branch)
			- make sure that code still works
	- Use this doc aswell/ cross reference with the chrono events at flow confluence
		- [Flow Branches](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16FtMyJhClkMwHV-GGZbU8IeHGtjKSt75_qi0zJudozc/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

		- we will be sifting through the github basically
	- Codebase Survey
	- Branch Audit
- WHERE TO START WITH ALL OF THE ABOVE
	- check if branch exits, check if confluence exits, add notes
		- if no confluence,
