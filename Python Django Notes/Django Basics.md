General Notes:
- created new project, C:\Users\Henry Pham\VSCode\Django-learning
- will be using for further development

Notes:
- DO note temper with manage.py
- `python manage.py startapp asiatoursagency`
	- manage.py stores cli commands
	- __init___.py
		- do not touch, allows python to see the directory as a package
		- how that works idk
		- used to import app modules elsewhere in project
	- admin.py
		- django allows interface to interact with database through admin interface
	- apps.py
		- config class to store specific settings
		- allows specifications of metadata
		- very important, this is where you link the name of your application
		- **IMPORTANT**
			- the "name =" defined in the autogenerated class must be included in your settings.py (within initial django directory)
			- asiatoursagency > apps.py
			- ![[Pasted image 20240814234647.png]]
			- tour > settings.py
			- ![[Pasted image 20240814234627.png]]
			- 
	- models.py
		- one of the most important
		- declare data models for your app
	- tests.py
		- unit testing
	- views.py
		- handles request response logic (mvt architecture)
	- migrations folder
		- has migration files for the applications
			- migration = log of changes
		- allows to migrate to different databases
- views.py
- every applications needs a url.py to be included in the main django directory
- recap
	- basically django urls.py contains the link to each application urls.py
		- does this through use of path function
		- within django urls.py make to sure to import include from django.urls
	- the idea is you run the main django directory, and that directory needs to figure out where its suppose to path to to get data/interface for the application, hence why everyone application needs its own urls.py so that django can connect to those urls and then the those urls handle the actual getting information from the application
		- django urls.py > application urls.py > application views.py
			- NOTE: applications are craeted using the django-admin startapp '' command
