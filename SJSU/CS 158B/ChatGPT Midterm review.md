## RMON (remote monitoring)
- extends SNMP, allows remote monitoring of a subnetwork rather than just devices, designed to be efficient and provide valuable insights without significantly increasing network load.
	- HOW? defines a MIB to monitor a network from a single device to an entire subnetwork
	- can store and can filter what is stored for future analysis
- Goals
	- RMON will collect and store data even if the manager isn't online, allows the manger to access this data later.
	- Proavtively monitors by diagnosing and logging performance data
	- Can perform analysis on data so manager doesnt have to
	- allows multiple managers to monitor the network simultaneously
- Configuration
	- RMON MIBs are organized into functional groups
		- control table: configured and specify what data to collect
		- data table: where collected data is stored
	- control table rows can be modified/deleted
- table management and structure
	- Control-Data Relationship: each row in control table has an associated row in data tables
	- Combined Tables: if single control row maps to single data row, control and data can be combined for efficiency
	- action Invocation: some RMON MIB objects represent actions, allowing the manager to trigger specific actions by settings values on these objects
