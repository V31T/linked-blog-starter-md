General stuff:

Kinds of Networks:

- FCAPS Model
	- one uniform model that can be applied to any network 
	- Fault Configuration Accounting Performance Security
		- called the 5 pillars of network management 
	- Fault Management
		- Goal: Detect, Isolate, and correct any abnormal operation
		- Fault:= an abnormal condition that requires management attention (or action) to repair
			- Fault != Single Error
				- network can handle that
		- Example: Link Down, Port Down, Device Down
	- Configuration Management
		- Goal: Configure all hosts and devices for their intended behavior
			- Drives network functionality
		- Originall, almost always humans involved
		- nowadays could be either
			- human driven or
			- Controller* driven
		- Controller: Higher level management software
		- Example:
			- port disable/enable
			- configure VLAN
			- configure tunnel
	- Accounting Management
		- Goal: gather all kinds of data from all hosts and devices
		- alternate names: Stats/ Metrics / telemetry
		- Example: Bytes sent/recieved, Packets sent/received
	- Performance Management
		- goal: ensure network performance remains at acceptable levels
			- tracks network health, quality-of-service, User experience
		- Example: Throughput, Latency, Loss rate, Utilization
			- THROUGHPUT VS LATENCY
				- Throughput: amount of data received and transmitted
					- what done in how much time
						- i.e. 100 pancakes per hour is throughput
						- i.e. packets per second that we are processing
				- Latency: the time between each
					- how long to do work
						- i.e. 1 pancake takes 30 seconds
						- amount of time it takes router to process the packet
		- SLA/SLO
			- Service Level Agreement
				- between consumer and provider (2 different entities)
				- "provider agrees something to the consumer"
				- i.e. "the service should be available 99% of the time"
					- usually comes with clauses 
			- Service Level Objective
				- internal to the provider 
				- "provider makes their own goals for themselves"
				- i.e. "AT&T wants to have their own network up 99% of the time"
		- connected to accounting because we need the data from there to assess performance
	- Security Management
		- Goal: to keep network secure
			- all access to the network are authenticated and authorized
			- generation, distribution, storing encryption keys
		- Example: Security Rules
			- i.e. when opening a file the system will check if we have permission to open the file
		- Usually a lot of rules
		- programmed into the host server and routers
	- ![[Pasted image 20240904195645.png]]
		- a very general model, will try to use to analyze networks
			- ask "what is the fcaps of this network"

	Network Management Systems (NMS)
	- Collection of tools for network configuration and monitoring that is integrated and unified in the following sense:
		- A single operator interface with a powerful but user friendly set of commands for performing most or all network management tasks
		- A minimum amount of separate equipment is necessary
			- That is, most of the hardware and software required for network management is incorporated into the existing user equipment
	Network Management Entity (NME)
	- Each device contains all collection of software deveoted to the NM task, often known as NME. each NME performs the following: 
		- collect stats on communication and network related activities
		- store stats locally
		- respond to commands from the network control center (NCC), e.g.,
			- Transmit collected stats to the NCC
			- Change a parameter (i.e. timer)
			- provide status info (i.e. parameter values)
			- generate artificial traffic to perform a test
		- send message to NCC when local conditions undergo significant change
	network management information
	- static: information that seldom changes
		- e.g. router id, number off ports
	- Dynamic: related to the events in a network
		- e.g. forwarding state of a port in a switch
	- Statistical: FREQUENTLY changing information
		- e.g. number of bytes sent/received, number of packets sent/received 
- Network Monitoring Configuration
	- Monitoring Application: Functions of network monitorying that are visible to the user
		- e.g. faults, performance
	- Manager function: retrieves information from other elements
	- Agent function: Gather and records management information for on or more network elements and communicates that to monitor
	- Managed objects: Management information representing something
	- an optionally....
		- Monitoring Agent: Aggregates and possible summarizes
			- agent to the monitoring application\
- Polling
	- Polling is a request-response interaction between the manager and the agent
- Event Reporting 
	- With event-reporting, the initiative is with the agent
		- manager is the role of the listener, waiting for the incoming information
	- A report could be:
		- periodic
			- with a preconfigured interval
			- .. that can be modified by the manager
		- significant event (e.g. state change)
		- unusual event (e.g. a fault)
- Performance Monitoring Indicators
	- Service-Oriented 
		- Availbility: % of time network or application is available to the users 
		- response time
			- how quickly you hear back from the server 
		- accuracy
			- making a query, am i okay with little bit of error or no
	- efficiency-Oriented
		- Throughput: events per unit time
		- Utilization: 5 of theoretical capacity of resource
- Performance Quest
	- is traffic evenly distributed among the network hosts or are there source-destination pairs with unusually heavy traffic?
	- What is the percentage of each type of packet? are some packet types of unusually high frequency, indicating an error, or an inefficient protocol?
	- What is the distribution of data packet size?
	- which host, port is the biggest source of traffic?
	- which host, port is the biggest sink of traffic?
		- ^^ VERY important questions that you should be able to answer
- Fault Monitoring
	- Problems:
		- Unobservable faults
			- e.g. 
- Problems:
	- What is the maximum yearly downtime for 3-nine SLA?
		- i.e. SLA = 99.9% uptime = 3-nine uptime
		- ![[Pasted image 20240904202238.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20240904202546.png]]
		- This is uptime coverage is done by software that manages the servers
			- comes down to distributed systems design 
	- There are 100 computers in a cluster. The probability of failure of a single computer is 0.1%. Assuming all computers are independent, what is the probability that there is at least one failure in the cluster?
		- 'at least 1' so any probability that has at least one failure
			- 1 - prob(no failure)
